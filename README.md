Notes from University of Messina 2nd year Data Analysis Student

Hi! Iâ€™m Ali, a second-year Data Analysis student at the University of Messina with a strong passion for biology, data analysis, and student consultancy. I split my time between Messina and Ankara, where I provide private tutoring in mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry, particularly for students attending French high schools.

At the University of Messina, my studies are focused on harnessing the power of data to solve complex problems, and I am particularly interested in applying these skills to the field of genetic data analysis. This combination of biological sciences and data analysis is where I aim to make a significant impact in the future.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am in the process of establishing a consultancy company to assist international students with their transition to life and studies in Italy, specifically at Messina University. My goal is to integrate my educational services with practical support to ensure students feel confident and prepared throughout their journey.

I also have an interest in investment and am exploring ways to enhance my knowledge in this area.
